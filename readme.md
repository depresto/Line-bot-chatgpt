# Line ChatGPT API

Here is a simple Node.js application that integrates a Line chatbot with OpenAI using several third-party packages. When a user sends a text message to the chatbot on Line, the application calls OpenAI's GPT-3 model to generate a response text and sends it back to Line.

The application primarily uses three third-party packages: @vercel/node, @line/bot-sdk, and openai, for handling HTTP requests, Line chatbot events, and API calls to OpenAI, respectively, to achieve text generation.

In the code, the application first checks if the required environment variables are set, then sets up the verification information for the Line chatbot using the middleware function. When the application receives an event from the Line chatbot, it parses the type and content of the event. If it is a text message, the application calls OpenAI's GPT-3 model to generate a response text, then sends it back to Line.

Finally, the application responds with an HTTP 200 status code to indicate that it has completed processing.
